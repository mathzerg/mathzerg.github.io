- [Notes on length-2 relative Hilbert scheme of Lefschetz fibration](../resources/Notes_on_length_2_relative_Hilbert_scheme_of_Lefschetz_fibration.pdf).  Took this when I tried to understand symplectic Khovanov homology.


- [Notes on Fukaya category](../resources/notes_on_fukaya_category.pdf).  A toy version of Auroux's note.
